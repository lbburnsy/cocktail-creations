Cocktail Creations

Using cocktaildb.com API we created an app that allows the user to find new and exciting drinks, based on a certain alcohol
Wheather you are an up and coming bartender or an at home party animal, this is an app that allows someone to find their favorite drink, or even a new one, based on a certain type of liquor.

Upon entering the page, the user chooses their favorite liquor and it takes them to a list of drinks made using that liquor
The user clicks on the desired drink and it bring them to a third page with a picture of what it looks like, the ingredients needed, and directions on how to make the drink
Then on another click it brings the user back to the main page to choose a new liquor, to start the process over, or choose a different drink

This app gives the user some different, and possibly new, ideas on drinks they can make. Instead of their standard Jack and Coke, the user may find a drink they didnt even know about and that could become their new favorite drink

Getting it totally responsive was a challenge for a little while, but eventually got it figured out. 
In the future we would like to link a Spotify or some other music App so that this app could be the party starter destination!
